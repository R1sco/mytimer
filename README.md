## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

* **Bash:** A modern version of Bash (standard on most Linux distros and macOS).

## üöÄ Installation

Make the script a global command so you can call it from anywhere in your terminal.

1.  **Make the script executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x timer.sh
    ```

2.  **Move it to a directory in your PATH:**
    The recommended location is `/usr/local/bin`. We'll also rename it to just `mytimer` to make it feel like a native command.
    ```bash
    sudo mv timer.sh /usr/local/bin/mytimer
    ```

---

## Usage

The command takes a duration and an optional message.

```bash
mytimer 10(h/m/s) (custom description)
example : mytimer 10s Take A Break
```
